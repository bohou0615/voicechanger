## high quality voice changers

# Idea
In this project, we aim to change the frequency of human voice and make the changed voice more natural without being detected robotic sounds.

# Method
Here, we apply three different methods to do this task. First is Phase vocoder, second is sinusoidal modeling and third is Straight vocoder. 
The first and second methods are based on Short-time Fast Fourier transform.
The thrid method utilizes legacy-STRAIGHT tool.

# Result

# Note
Main file is in DSP_Final. \
ohter .m files are for the second method. \
Straight Vocoder needs to be downloaded from https://github.com/HidekiKawahara/legacy_STRAIGHT.git  \
